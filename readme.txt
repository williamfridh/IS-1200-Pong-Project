*Note that these steps are just general instructions. They may vary depending on your system.*

To compile the code, you need the following:
* The files (download via the button above)
* MCB32 toolchain (available on the course page)
* A pic32 board connected to the computer via USB

Now, you simply have to enter the MCB32 environment, navigate to the folder and execute the following commands:

The first command is for compiling the code. Here, you'll see if you got any errors:
"make;"

The second command will install the compiled files on the chip kit:
"make install;"

Now, unless you got any errors, the code should be sent to the pic32.
